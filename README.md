# Collapsible Mobile Menu

### What is this?
A little concept of collapsible sidebar menu developed using Vanilla JS, HTML5 and CSS3.

### How can I run it on my computer?
It's pretty easy:

* Type `$ npm install` for install NPM dependencies
* Type `$ bower install` for install Bower dependencies
* Type `grunt && grunt vendor` for generate the /dist folder

### Can I help?
