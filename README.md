# Collapsible Mobile Menu

### What is this?
**THIS IS NOT A LIBRARY**.

You guys can't use it as a ready-to-use dependency in your project.

This is just a little concept of collapsible sidebar menu developed using Vanilla JS, HTML5 and CSS3 for studying purposes.

If you want to add it into your project, you should check the source code (for inspiration) and code it in your project. A copy and paste is valid too, but you'll probably need to change some stuff.

### How can I run it on my computer?
It's pretty easy:

* Type `$ npm install` for install NPM dependencies
* Type `$ bower install` for install Bower dependencies
* Type `grunt && grunt vendor` for generate the /dist folder

### Can I help?
If you think that something can be improved, feel free to make your pull request. Code refactors, bug fixes, improvements and almost anything are welcome. :)
